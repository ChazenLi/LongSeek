# LongSeek    
## INFO
### 1.  This is a part of collection of what I have done in the past two years(maybe longer considered the preparation);    
### 2.  This collection also contains some interesting test and exploration which may be helpful in the futrue newframework design;    

## CONCLUSION
### 1.  Without physical constraint, NN may output anything（data assimilation based on physical constraint is powerful and）;    
### 2.  information2vector is the base and I can design some intersting programor test from MC/MC the pre of HMM and SD.          
### 3.  CA == auto-MC and VAE == SD;      
### 4.  lack of GPU...
